### Course: Operating Systems 1

Welcome to the repository for my Operating Systems 1 project. This project is developed as part of the coursework at the University of Belgrade, Faculty of Electrical Engineering.

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a basic operating system kernel that supports time-sharing and preemption. The primary focus is on the core functionalities of the operating system, such as process management, memory management, and handling system calls.

### Key Features:
- **Thread Management**: Implementation of context switching (synchronous and asynchronous - timer), scheduling, and thread synchronization.
- **Memory Management**: Basic memory allocation and deallocation, using contiguous memory allocation.
- **System Calls**: Handling essential system calls for memory management, threads, semaphores and console I/O operations.
- **Console Buffering**: Efficient handling of console I/O with buffer management.
